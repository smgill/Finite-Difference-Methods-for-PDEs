    "# Alternating Direction Implicit Method Applied to the 3D Wave Equation\n",
    "Both the simple explicit and simple implicit methods used in `simple_explicit_implicit_methods.ipynb` can be applied to higher-dimensional problems. However, they become very computationally expensive<sub>[1]</sub>. This motivates the alternating direction implicit method (ADI), which combines the simple explicit and simple implicit methods to produce finite difference discretizations corresponding to efficiently-solvable tridiagonal matrix equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be shown in this notebook that ADI can be applied to solving the hyperbolic wave equation:\n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial t^{2}} = c^{2} \\nabla^{2} u $$\n",

    "\n",
    "There is now a choice to be made regarding finite difference discretizations of the spatial partial derivatives. Either the implicit or explicit methods could be employed to approximate a second derivative in an arbitrary spatial dimension. Superscripts denote a time step and subscripts denote a spatial node for the remainder of this document. The explicit central difference discretization is taken at the current time step, $l$, so that the values of $u$ are known thanks to an initial condition:\n",

    "Rather than solving for the future values of $u$ in all dimensions at once, the implicit discretization can be applied to one dimension at a time and the resulting tridiagonal matrix equation solved for values at a partial time step in the future<sub>[2]</sub>.
